# Full stack template

- this template is for projects that includes the following stack:
  1. frontend (client): [HTML], [TailwindCSS], [SASS], [ReactJS] and [ViteJS].
  2. backend (server): [REST_API], [NodeJS], [ExpressJS], [Webpack] and any [Database] of your choice.

- so basically it is the DERN stack (Database Express React and Node), where there is no specific stereotypic database to use.


## Setup

- first, you must npm install all packages that are inside the [package.json] files.

- second, you can remove what you don't want or need, and start building the project. 

- third, you must un-comment the `*/.env` line inside [.gitignore], as they must stay secret files
